# Instacart_Python project

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app and serves customers all over the US. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The marketing and sales departments requested an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. This project helped inform the strategy Instacart uses to target the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

The data was provided by the marketing and sales departments and contained information relating to products, customers and orders.
